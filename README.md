# Image_Processing_Project_Part_2
This project builds on the earlier image processing work, however models the journeys taken by 25 'drunk people' from a public house to their respective homes. The method models the journeys taken by the 'drunk individuals', who move randomly left, right up or down, until they reach their house. A record of the number of individuals who pass through each point on the map is taken and then displayed as a density map.

The project comprises 3 separate classes;

Ø  The Storage class, which stores geographical image data and is called upon by methods in other classes to process this data so that it can be displayed as an image.

Ø  The IO class, which includes methods that read and then write out geographical data to a given file.

Ø  The Analyst class, which can be used to display geographical data within a Graphical User Interface (GUI), and calls upon data and methods in other classes to display geographical data within the GUI.
